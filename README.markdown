Charcoal Neon Tetra
===================

This is a [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) theme based on the excellent [Monokai theme](http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/15/textmate-color-theme/) but tweaked to suit my sensibilities. The name of the theme came from the vibrant colours of the [Tetra Neon fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_tetra) that my parents kept in our tropical fish tank when I was a kid.


Installation
------------

To install, simply download the `Charcoal Neon Tetra.tmtheme` file and either double-click it or copy it manually to the `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Themes` folder on your Mac. 

Once that's done, restart TextMate and select the new theme on the `Fonts & Colours` tab of the Preferences window.
